#summary How CashForward uses the NetBeans Lookup facilities

= Introduction =

The NetBeans Lookup mechanism provides support for managing selection, or application context. For instance, if I want to know when a Payment has been selected, I can ask the Lookup context to tell me. This allows for a cleaner separation of the interface and other application components, and reduces the amount of code I need to write.

NetBeans has two ways of handling context: a Lookup within the application Windows (TopComponents) and within the application Nodes (Nodes are a [http://wiki.netbeans.info/wiki/view/DevFaqWhatIsANode hierarchical presentation model]). 

See the [http://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/60/nbm-selection-1.html NetBeans Selection Management Tutorial] for even more information.

= A Central Lookup =

CashForward [CashForwardDesign doesn't use Nodes] at the moment, and so utilizes the TopComponent approach to handling context. Each TopComponent has its own collection of objects and state, which it holds in a map. Other objects are able to put things in the collection and ask for things back from each TopComponent. 

The UIContext takes this a step further and provides one central Lookup implementation for TopComponents and other parts of the interface to share. This Lookup is initialized apart from the rest of the interface. It also uses the GlazedLists EventList pipeline so to allow components to observe changes to master lists.
