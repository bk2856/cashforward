The release for the NetBeans Grant submission is [http://cashforward.googlecode.com/files/cashforward.zip available]. It is exported directly from NetBeans - look in the cashforward/bin for the executable.

Note: this is an undocumented release. Over the next two days the documentation will fill on. Watch the Documentation space for details.

Thanks!
