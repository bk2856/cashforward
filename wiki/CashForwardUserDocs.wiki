== Intro ==

In CashForward, Bills and Deposits are called _Payments_. Each Payment has one _Payee_ (who the Payment is coming from). Payments can also be tagged with _Labels_. Labels are useful for putting bills/deposits in certain groups or categories (e.g. Entertainment expenses, or income).

Payments can also be scheduled. Scheduled Payments are used to help project cashflow.

Once a payments have been created, they can be associated with different _Scenarios_. For instance, you can compare your current Scenario (budget) with what it may look like with a car payment, or additional income.
