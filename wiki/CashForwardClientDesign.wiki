#summary The design of the CashForward Client (NetBeans Grant Milestone)

= Introduction =

This document will take a brief look at the client module implemented in the NetBeans Grant Milestone Release.

CashForwardUI? contains the core user interface for working with {{{Payment}}}s and [CashForwardServicesDesign the services need to calculate, manage, and persist Payment information]. 


= User Interface Structure =

The user interface is organized into a few important layers. 

   * Form/Presentation
   * Actions
   * Adapter

== Forms/Presentation ==

The presentation/form layers are divided up between several components - {{{Payment}, {{{Scenario}}}, and {{{Task}}}. These are also the three main {{{TopComponent}}}s you see in the interface. 

Each of these packages, {{{org.cashforward.ui.payment}}},{{{org.cashforward.ui.scenario}}},{{{org.cashforward.ui.task}}} also contain supporting forms for input and display. 

== Actions ==

The {{{org.cashforward.ui.action}}} package contains the actions for the menu/toolbars (usually inheriting off of {{{org.cashforward.action.BaseCallableSystemAction}}}) and other system actions.
